# **MODEL AND COST FUNCTION**

Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng.
Week 1: Model and Cost Function.

## **MODEL REPRESENTATION**

To establish notation for future use, we’ll use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x^{(i)}"> to denote the “input” variables (living area in this example), also called input features, and <img  src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y^{(i)}"> to denote the “output” or target variable that we are trying to predict (price). A pair <img  src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(x^{(i)},y^{(i)})"> is called a training example, and the dataset that we’ll be using to learn _a list of m training examples_ <img  src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?{(x^{(i)},y^{(i)});i=1,...,m}"> is called a training set. Note that the superscript “(i)” in the notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation. We will also use X to denote the space of input values, and Y to denote the space of output values. In this example, X = Y = ℝ.

To describe the supervised learning problem slightly more formally, our goal is, given a training set, to learn a function h : X → Y so that h(x) is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of y. For historical reasons, this function h is called a hypothesis. Seen pictorially, the process is therefore like this:

<p align="center"><img src="./assets/img001.png"></p>

When the target variable that we’re trying to predict is continuous, such as in our housing example, we call the learning problem a regression problem. When y can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we call it a classification problem.

## **COST FUNCTION**

We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function. This takes an average difference (actually a fancier version of an average) of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual output y's.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?J(\theta_0,\theta_1)=\dfrac{1}{2m}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^m\left(\hat{y}_{i}-y_{i}\right)^2=\dfrac{1}{2m}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^m\left(h_\theta(x_{i})-y_{i}\right)^2">

To break it apart, it is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{1}{2}\bar{x}"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bar{x}"> is the mean of the squares of <img  src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h_\theta(x_{i})-y_{i}">, or the difference between the predicted value and the actual value.

This function is otherwise called the "Squared error function", or "Mean squared error". The mean is halved <img  src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)"> as a convenience for the computation of the gradient descent, as the derivative term of the square function will cancel out the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{1}{2}"> term. The following image summarizes what the cost function does:

## **COST FUNCTION**

If we try to think of it in visual terms, our training data set is scattered on the x-y plane. We are trying to make a straight line (defined by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h_\theta(x))">) which passes through these scattered data points.

Our objective is to get the best possible line. The best possible line will be such so that the average squared vertical distances of the scattered points from the line will be the least. Ideally, the line should pass through all the points of our training data set. In such a case, the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?J(\theta_0, \theta_1)"> will be 0. The following example shows the ideal situation where we have a cost function of 0.

<p align="center"><img src="./assets/img003.png"></p>

When <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\theta_1=1">, we get a slope of 1 which goes through every single data point in our model. Conversely, when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\theta_1=0.5">, we see the vertical distance from our fit to the data points increase.

<p align="center"><img src="./assets/img004.png"></p>

This increases our cost function to 0.58. Plotting several other points yields to the following graph:

<p align="center"><img src="./assets/img005.png"></p>

Thus as a goal, we should try to minimize the cost function. In this case, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\theta_1=1"> is our global minimum.
